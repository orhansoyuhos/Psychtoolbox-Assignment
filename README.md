This project is my final assignment for the Introduction to MATLAB course, where I used Psychtoolbox to write an interactive learning environment for teaching English to kids.

*BEFORE RUNNING: please check the main directory (main_dir), speaker device number (deviceid) 
	and (my_device_right_click)

*Please run the file named 'ENGLISH_FOR_KIDS_run'
	-It includes all the code I have written.
	-The other files are for calling 'ENGLISH_FOR_KIDS_run' from the command window.
	-I used extra images for the letters.
	-The Excel file called 'number_of_errors.xls' has previous data from my trials. 
		I did not clean it to have figures. 
	-IMPORTANT: If you would like to clean the previous data, 
		please do not delete the first columns that has names.
